# List of Five Claims
1. [A Mixed Up Mixed Layer](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/02/02/a-mixed-up-mixed-layer/)
* Summary: provides an alternative interpretation of the findings of research conducted on the methods employed analyzing shallowing of the mixed layer residing at water surface levels, which provides a buffer against deep marine heating.
* Explanation: the author appears to have researched the methodology employed to compare and contrast them, then to demonstrate inherent differences or issues with the interpretation.  

2. [Coral Reefs are Dying Because of Climate Change.](https://everythingclimate.org/coral-reefs-are-dying-because-of-climate-change/)
* Summary: coral resilience is misconstrued in mainstream climate media and they will experience a smooth adaptation to warming climates, through symbiotic algae.
* Explanation: the article addresses that coral has evolved through various climates, incidences of coral recovering from recent bleaching events and mentions a route by which corals may adapt while referencing other sites, articles and papers throughout.  

3. [Could Recent U.S. Warming Trends be Largely Spurious?](http://www.drroyspencer.com/2021/01/could-recent-u-s-warming-trends-be-largely-spurious/)
* Summary: official land temperature datasets should be questioned, or viewed with scrutiny because they fail to account for changes in temperature due to increasing population density.
* Explanation: the article describes various methods, data and models employed, as well as corroborating peers’ work, and is authored by an individual with a Ph.D. in meteorology.

4. [More trees do not always create a cooler planet, Clark University geographer finds](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/02/14/more-trees-do-not-always-create-a-cooler-planet-clark-university-geographer-finds/)
* Summary: reports findings from Clark University regarding the importance of forests increasing regions’ albedos and thereby warming the local climate to contrast their potential in carbon capturing for planting projects.
* Explanation: the research is funded through NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System, motivated to improve the resource allocation and design of large-scale tree planting efforts, and the methodology is described, partially through the quotes of one of the leading researchers.


5. [Elevated CO2 Reduces the Survival Rate of the Confused Sap Beetle](http://www.co2science.org/articles/V24/jan/a11.php)
* Summary: A study conducted to elucidate the effects of CO2 concentrations on the crop pest, the confused sap beetle, *Carpophilus mutilatus*, finds that survival rates dropped immensely, promising fewer outbreaks as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and the climate warms.
* Explanation: the methods and results of the study are discussed and properly referenced and discusses the economic benefit of fewer pests on crop yields.

# Evaluating "A Mixed Up Mixed Layer"
 The article in question, *A Mixed Up Layer*, provides alternative interpretation to another article regarding the findings discussed in a study conducted by Amaya et al. investigating whether North Pacific marine heatwaves were being influenced by the changes in the Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) (Eschenbach, 2021; Amaya et al., 2021). This is based off of the author’s exploration of the four methods for calculating MLD within the field, using the data available by Argo, or Argo floats. These methods are temperature threshold, temperature algorithms, density threshold, and density algorithms (Eschenbach, 2021). According to the article, the algorithmic methods provide shallower average MLDs than the threshold methods and the discrepancies between the averages provided by the different methods is large. Thus, the author disputes the claim that mixed layer depth has changed significantly during the 21st century, and further, cites internal climate variability as a challenge in ascertaining whether the depths are shallowing, if at all, due to rising temperatures (Eschenbach, 2021). These statements are interesting because it questions the credibility of the scientific method employed by the discipline, as well as criticizes the article it initially addresses for misinforming its audience in the spirit of climate alarmism.  
 Eschenbach is a blogger on Watts Up With That (WUWT), graduated Sonoma State University with a bachelor’s in psychology and is described as an amateur scientist who has been studying climate science for 15 years (The Heartland Institute, 2016). He does not possess the traditional credentials or education background of a climate scientist. Including the investigation that he describes in the article regarding the methods employed, his publications, or blogs, are not peer reviewed research nor does he make his methods available for replicability. Thus, it is important to note the article’s designated audience are members of the general public which frequent the climate denial blog. Furthermore, given the publication, there is higher risk of bias for climate alarmism being introduced into the analysis, particularly since it is not subject to peer review.  
 Within the article, several logical fallacies can be observed. Eschenbach’s description of the four different methodologies is rather generalized. For example, according to the scientific articles he cites for his understanding of the methodologies, threshold methods can vary due to differences in choice criterion, such as using pre-existing average profiles of the region or direct MLD estimates taken from individual profiles (Montégut et al., 2004). There can also be variability due to the frequency of data collection, the literature values obtained, and the methods employed to choose threshold values (Montégut et al., 2004). Eschenbach appears to utilise methods from 2004, which may not be relevant to research in 2019, or appropriate to compare to. Eschenbach also makes use of Argo data in his observations, and though it is unclear what exact methods he used, it would be important to consider that one data set cannot be representative of all regions or alternative sources (Eschenbach, 2021). This is another generalization without justification that the author makes. The article also asserts that further research must be conducted to determine whether MLDs are shallowing due to rise in temperature and this is corroborated by Amaya et al. (2021). However, this neglects that MLDs are shallower during the summer season and the findings of Amaya et al. (2021) regarding increasing frequency and intensity MLD anomalies in response to climate change. Overall, there appears to be inappropriate comparisons drawn throughout the article which serve to further a biased alarmist narrative.  

# Common Themes
The authors of alarmist or similarly themed articles could frequently be seen citing or referencing other articles which seemed to corroborate with the evidence or analysis they were providing however investigating these references would not usually yield what would be considered peer reviewed or credible papers or sources. This appeared to be a case of sampling bias or cherry picking, as well as confirmation bias. The narratives, across these articles, often framed their motivations as seeking truth, desiring economic growth, works to debunk climate myths or some close variant. Frequently, the articles would begin by conceding to a supposedly mainstream climate truth or by re framing the mainstream climate media argument and then provide a separate alternative analysis that would subvert this. Common logical fallacies included the bandwagon appeal and the straw man as authors could be seen hyper fixating on details and lacking analysis on a larger scale.
